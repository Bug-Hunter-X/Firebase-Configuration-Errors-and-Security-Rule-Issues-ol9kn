To fix these errors, carefully review your `firebase.json` configuration, making sure all the necessary keys and URLs are present and accurate.  Verify that the configuration matches the settings defined in your Firebase project console.  Pay close attention to security rules; incorrect rules can prevent data access. Ensure that your rules allow the appropriate read and write operations for your application. Use the Firebase console to test and debug security rule issues. Example of correcting missing API key:
```javascript
// Incorrect configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // ... other settings
};

// Corrected configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Add your API key
  // ... other settings
};
```
