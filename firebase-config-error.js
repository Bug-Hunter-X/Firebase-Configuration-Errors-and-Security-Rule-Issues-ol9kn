The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration is incorrect or incomplete. This can happen if you're missing the necessary API keys, database URLs, or other credentials in your `firebase.json` file or environment variables.  Another issue can arise if there's a mismatch between your Firebase project settings in the console and the configuration in your application code.  Additionally, issues with security rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore can lead to unexpected errors when attempting to read or write data.
